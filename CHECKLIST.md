Launch tracking

Edit this issue to keep track of the tasks you're working on towards launch.

We have a rough guide for how to launch a track, which is sorely outdated but
quite possibly better than nothing (I'm so sorry, I'm waaaay behind on getting
documentation updated).
https://github.com/exercism/legacy-docs/blob/main/language-tracks/launch/README.md

Check out https://github.com/orgs/exercism/teams/track-maintainers/discussions/1
for details about the #maintaining-\<track\> channels and private #maintainers channel in the exercism-team Slack workspace.

Please ask if you have any questions or if anything is confusing!
